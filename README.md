## Acknowledgments

* Hat tip to [dylanbeattie](https://github.com/dylanbeattie/) for creating Rockstar
* The FizzBuzz example works well. If valid code doesn't work, create an issue so I can get a look.
* I'll work on the readibility and organization of the code, would love suggestions on how/where to do that.
